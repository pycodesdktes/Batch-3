DESCRIPTION:

The Base converter App In Python is a simple project developed using Python.
The project contains a base conversion system and calculator. The user can
enter any number and convert them to any number systems (like decimal to
binary, binary to octal, etc.). Moreover, the user can also use a calculator from
this application.
This is a simple GUI-base project which is very easy to understand and use.
Also, this project makes a convenient way for the user to gain an idea of how
to perform number conversion.
In this project, we built a calculator we can use to convert any number from
any base to any other base. In number systems, “Base” tells us how many
numbers you have available. Binary has 2, octal has 8, decimal has 10 etc.
The program can handle any number and base we throw at it. This program
covers several aspects of programming.
