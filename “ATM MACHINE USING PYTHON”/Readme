The Project describes model of ATM Machine using python which basically
does operations like balance enquiry, cash withdrawal and cash deposit.
Time module is imported in this project. Time module allows us to
use time.sleep() function. Due to this function program sleeps for provided
amount of time which is usually in seconds.
Program asks for card. After inserting card program waits for 5 seconds, reads
chip data and asks for Password.
Note: Password must be 4 digit Number
It will need pin for reconfirmation of password. Program continuously asks for
pin until both Pin and Password are matched. For this While loop is used.
When Password and Pin are matched it will print options as follows:
i. Balance Enquiry
ii. Withdraw Amount
iii. Deposit
We have provided balance of Rs.10000. All above operations are done with
respect to this provided balance.
Program provides 3 options; if user enters option 1, program just checks
account balance and prints it. Option 2 is for amount withdrawal. It asks for
amount to be withdrawal, subtracts it from account balance and prints
remaining balance. Option 3 is Deposit. It asks for total amount that user wants
to credit adds that amount to account balance and prints updated account balance.
